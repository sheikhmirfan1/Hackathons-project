HTML with CSS

Overview:
This README provides an overview of an HTML project built with CSS. It explains the purpose of the project, its features, and how to use and customize it.

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to create a visually appealing and interactive web page using HTML and CSS. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used for structuring the content of the web page, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling and layout.

Features:
1. Structure: The HTML file(s) in this project provide the structure of the web page, including headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, and more. The HTML elements are used to organize and present the content.

2. Styling: The CSS file(s) in this project define the visual appearance of the web page. CSS allows you to customize the colors, fonts, sizes, margins, padding, and other visual aspects of the HTML elements. It also enables you to create layouts, such as columns and grids.

3. Responsiveness: The CSS in this project can be used to make the web page responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes and devices. Media queries can be utilized to apply different styles based on the screen width, allowing for a better user experience on mobile devices.
